A Simple Student Information System

How it works:

1.) Enter IDnumber, full name, gender, year level, and course code in their corresponding text entries.

2.) After inputting all student data, click the "Save Student" button to save.

3.) Course code will display "None" if you wish to leave out the 'Course Code' combobox.

4.) To edit student data/course, select a row you want to edit from the student table/course table you wish to edit, then click the "Edit Student/Edit Course" button to proceed with editing. The original data will appear in another frame where the actual editing happens. When done, click the "Update" button to save the updated data or the "cancel" button to cancel changes.

5.) To delete student/course, select a row you wish to delete from the student table/course table, then click the "Delete Student/Delete Course" button to remove it. In the confirmation prompt, click 'Yes', if you want to remove the data permanently, otherwise, click 'No'.

6.) To search/filter student data/course, search by providing the ID number/Course Code you wish to find, then click the "Search" button. The student record/specific course you're looking for should appear in their corresponding tables. 
Just click the "back" button to return to the student/course list.

7.) Select the "Clear All Text" button to clear all the entered data from the text entries.
